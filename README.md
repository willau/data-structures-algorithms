+ [ ] Binary search tree 

## Queue
- Implemented with an array
- Implemented with a linked list

## Stack 
- Implemented with an array
- Implemented with a linked list

## Sort
+ Quick sort algorithm
    + Worst --> O(n^2)
    + Average --> O(nlogn)
    + Best --> O(nlogn)
+ Insertion sort
    + Worst --> O(n^2)
    + Average --> O(n^2)
    + Best --> O(n)
+ Selection sort
    + Worst --> O(n^2)
    + Average --> O(n^2)
    + Best --> O(n^2)
+ Merge sort
+ Heap sort
    
## Tree
- Keywords: root, edge, child, parent, leaf, height, depth
- DFS
    + pre-order
    + post-order
    + in-order or symetric

## Binary search tree
