# Data Structures and Algorithms

Improving my understanding of data structures and algorithms

## List
Assume size of list is n:
- Implemention of a list with an array
- Implemention of a list with a linked list


## Stack
- Implemention of a stack with an array
- Implemention of a stack with a linked list


##Â Sorting
- Fast sorting
    + Partition, 
        + Worst     --> O(n^2)
        + Average   --> O(nlogn)
        + Best      --> O(nlogn)
