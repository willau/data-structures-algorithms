# Data Structures and Algorithms

Improving my understanding of data structures and algorithms


## Stack 
- Implemented with an array
- Implemented with a linked list


## Queue
- Implemented with an array
- Implemented with a linked list

##Â Sorting
+ Fast sorting
    + Partition function
        + Worst --> O(n^2)
        + Average --> O(nlogn)
        + Best --> O(nlogn)
